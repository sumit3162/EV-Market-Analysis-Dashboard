![Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/sumit3162/EV-Market-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/image%20copy.png)

An interactive, front-end dashboard to analyze India's Electric Vehicle (EV) market using smart visualizations and segmentation—**without merging datasets**.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project provides insights into the Indian EV landscape with:

- **Independent dataset analytics** (no joins required)
- **Visual tools** for understanding adoption, infrastructure, and environment
- **Fully responsive** and animated interface

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧠 Analytical Techniques
- **Cross-dataset Correlation Analysis** – EV sales vs charging infra.
- **Geographic Heatmaps** – Dual overlays for adoption & infra.
- **Market Readiness Scoring** – Composite index with radar and progress bars.

### 📊 Visualizations
- Leaflet-based dynamic maps
- Animated progress bars and radar charts
- Toggleable city-level insights

### 💻 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, Leaflet.js
- **Optional Backend**: Python (for data preprocessing)
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `folium`, `scikit-learn`

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumit3162/EV-Market-Analysis-Dashboard.git
cd EV-Market-Analysis-Dashboard
````

### 2. Install Python Dependencies (For dynamic backend)

```bash
pip install pandas folium scikit-learn
```

### 3. Launch Dashboard

* **Static version**:
  Open `index.html` directly in any browser.

* **Local server (recommended)**:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Then go to http://localhost:8000
```

## 📁 Data Requirements

Place the following files into the `data/` directory:

| File Name               | Description                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ev_sales.csv`          | EV registrations by city                     |
| `charging_stations.csv` | EV charging infrastructure                   |
| `pollution_data.csv`    | Pollution and air quality data (CPCB format) |

> Sample data is included under `data/sample/`

## 🧪 How to Use

### 1. 🔗 Correlation View

* Correlates EV adoption with infrastructure
* Real-time animated gauge meter for visual strength

### 2. 🗺️ Dual Heatmaps

* EV density (🔴 red) vs Charging infra (🔵 blue)
* Toggle animation with switch
* City markers show EV & charger counts

### 3. 📈 Readiness Scoreboard

* Filter/search cities
* Radar chart shows adoption vs infra vs pollution
* Progress bars animate to final readiness score

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### ➕ Add Your Data

**Modify** `scripts/main.js`:

```js
const evData = {
  'your-city': 1500,
  // Add more
};
```

**Update** `scripts/map.js`:

```js
const cities = {
  'your-city': { lat: 12.345, lng: 67.890, ev: 1500, chargers: 120 }
};
```

**Adjust** scoring weights in `scripts/scores.js`:

```js
const weights = {
  adoption: 0.4,
  infrastructure: 0.3,
  pollution: 0.3
};
```
