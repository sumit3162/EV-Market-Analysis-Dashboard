![Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/sumit3162/EV-Market-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/image%20copy.png)

An interactive dashboard for analyzing India's Electric Vehicle market using advanced segmentation techniques without merging datasets.

## Features

- **Three Analytical Techniques**:
  - Cross-dataset correlation analysis
  - Geographic heatmap overlays
  - Market readiness scoring

- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Animated charts and progress bars
  - Dynamic Leaflet maps with dual heatmaps
  - Filterable city readiness tables

- **Technical Highlights**:
  - Dataset independence - no merging required
  - Responsive Bootstrap 5 design
  - Animated transitions between views

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumit3162/EV-Market-Analysis-Dashboard.git
   cd ev-market-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies (none required for static version):
   ```bash
   # For development with Python backend:
   pip install pandas folium scikit-learn
   ```

3. Open in browser:
   - Simply open `index.html` in any modern browser
   - For development server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
     Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## Data Requirements

Place these files in the `data/` directory:

- `ev_sales.csv` - EV registration counts by city
- `charging_stations.csv` - Charging infrastructure data
- `pollution_data.csv` - Air quality metrics (CPCB format)

Sample datasets are provided in `data/sample/`.

## Usage

1. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - View relationship between EV adoption and charging infrastructure
   - Animated correlation meter shows strength of relationship

2. **Dual Heatmap**:
   - Compare EV density (red) vs charging stations (blue)
   - Toggle animation with the switch control
   - Click markers for city details

3. **Readiness Scores**:
   - Filter cities by name
   - Select cities to view score composition radar chart
   - Progress bars animate to their values

## Customization

To adapt for your own data:

1. Modify the data loading in `scripts/main.js`:
   ```javascript
   const evData = {
     'your-city': 1500,
     // Add your data
   };
   ```

2. Update map coordinates in `scripts/map.js`:
   ```javascript
   const cities = {
     'your-city': { lat: 12.345, lng: 67.890, ev: 1500, chargers: 120 }
   };
   ```

3. Adjust scoring weights in `scripts/scores.js`:
   ```javascript
   const weights = {
     adoption: 0.4,
     infrastructure: 0.3,
     pollution: 0.3
   };
   ```
